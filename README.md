# ⚙️ Predictive Maintenance for Equipment Failure Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project applies **data science and machine learning techniques** to forecast equipment malfunctions, reduce downtime, and optimize maintenance scheduling. By predicting failures before they occur, industries can improve efficiency, minimize unexpected costs, and extend equipment lifespan.

## 🛠️ Workflow  

### 1. 🔍 Data Preprocessing  
Performed thorough cleaning and feature engineering steps to prepare the dataset for modeling:  
- ✅ Loaded and inspected the dataset structure (rows, columns, data types)  
- 📅 Converted date columns and extracted features (year, month, day, weekday)  
- 🧹 Handled missing values  
- 📊 Detected and treated outliers (via IQR and visualization with boxplots)  
- 🏷️ Encoded categorical features (sector, equipment, etc.)  
- 📏 Scaled numerical variables for model readiness  

### 2. 🤖 Model Implementation  
Three machine learning models were implemented for predictive maintenance:  
- 🟠 **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** – sequence modeling for time-series sensor data  
- 🌲 **Random Forest** – ensemble method for robust predictions  
- 🐈 **CatBoost** – gradient boosting optimized for categorical features  

### 3. 📊 Model Comparison & Visualization  
- 📈 Trained and evaluated all models using predictive maintenance metrics  
- 🔎 Compared **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**  
- 📉 Visualized results to highlight trade-offs in performance  
- 🏆 Provided a summary of which models performed best in different aspects

## 📊 Results Summary  
- **LSTM** captured sequential dependencies, suitable for temporal patterns in equipment failure.  
- **Random Forest** provided stable results with less tuning required.  
- **CatBoost** excelled at handling categorical variables, offering strong accuracy with fewer preprocessing needs.  

The comparison shows that **no single model is universally best** — instead, performance depends on the use case (e.g., real-time monitoring vs. long-term forecasting).
